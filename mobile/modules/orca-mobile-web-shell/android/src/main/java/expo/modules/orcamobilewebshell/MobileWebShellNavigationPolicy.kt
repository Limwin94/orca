/**
 * The whole decision.
 *
 * Three rules, in this order, and the order is the design.
 *
 * A navigation outside the main frame is the sealed preview frame loading itself. It is refused and
 * never offered: forwarding it would let an artifact ask for a browser with no tap behind it.
 *
 * **The document URL loads only when the shell asked for it.** `isShellLoad` is a flag the view
 * raises around its own `loadUrl` and drops at commit; nothing a document does can raise it. Every
 * other navigation naming the document is refused and never offered -- offering the shell's own URL
 * to the opener would send the user out of the app instead of reloading it.
 *
 * Nothing here rests on the host reporting a gesture. Chromium's own documentation allows
 * `hasGesture()` to be false for a request a human started, and a sandboxed subframe navigating the
 * top frame reports no gesture at all -- measured on WebKit, where the same navigation arrives as
 * `.other`. Under a gesture-shaped rule that is an allow and a shell reload: the reply proxy
 * dropped, the load state restarted, the page's state gone.
 *
 * `isFromSubframe` is the iOS twin's second discriminator, where the initiating frame is readable.
 * Chromium does not report it here, so this platform passes false and rests on the flag alone.
 *
 * That leaves one residual, stated rather than papered over. Between `loadUrl` raising the flag and
 * `onPageStarted` dropping it, a navigation to the document URL started inside the sealed preview
 * frame would be allowed, because nothing in this callback says which frame asked. Reaching it needs
 * a generation switch and a tap inside that window, and no host discriminator exists to close it;
 * iOS closes the same gap with `sourceFrame`. It is the one case a device proof has to look at.
 *
 * What is left for the gesture is the only thing an artifact may ask for: a foreign URL, refused
 * and handed to the opener. A download naming the document is refused by the rule above instead,
 * without an offer, because `<a href="/" download>` is the shell's own URL however it is dressed.
 * `isDownload` is always false here and is carried so this reads as its iOS twin does; Chromium
 * never offers a download through `shouldOverrideUrlLoading`, it goes to the `DownloadListener` the
 * view installs as a no-op.
 *
 * Which URLs may actually open is not decided here -- `readBridgeExternalLinkUrl` owns the scheme
 * list, in the half that ships over the air.
